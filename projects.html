                <strong>Born2beRoot (42cursus) 2023 Project</strong><br>
                As part of the "42cursus" program in 2023, I successfully completed the "Born2beRoot" project, a challenging assignment focused on system administration and security. The project's primary objective was to establish a secure and fully functional web server, adhering to stringent security standards, with a specific emphasis on operating in text mode on Rocky Linux.
                
                <strong>Key Details:</strong><br>
                Tools and Technologies: Executed the project using various tools and technologies <br>
                including: Configured server settings through text-based configuration files. <br>
                Implemented rigorous security measures and access controls.<br>
                Utilized SSL/TLS protocols to ensure secure data transmission in a text-based environment.<br>
                
                <strong>Achievements and Outcomes:</strong><br>
                RockyLinux Text Mode Implementation: Successfully configured and secured the web server operating exclusively in text mode on the RockyLinux platform.<br>
                Hardened Security: Implemented robust security measures, fortifying the server against potential vulnerabilities and cyber threats.<br>
                Firewall Rules: Defined and enforced stringent firewall rules, exercising precise control over incoming and outgoing network traffic.<br>
                SSL/TLS Integration: Successfully incorporated SSL/TLS protocols, enhancing data encryption and privacy for users accessing the server in a text-based interface.<br>
                Comprehensive Documentation: Delivered meticulous documentation detailing the server setup, security implementations, and configuration, serving as a valuable resource for the development community.<br>
                
                <strong>Impact:</strong><br>
                Enhanced Security Practices: The project underscored my commitment to implementing and maintaining high-level security practices in server administration.<br>
                Skill Development: Strengthened my proficiency in server configuration, security protocols, and documentation, laying a foundation for future projects and real-world applications.<br>
                The project's success reflects my dedication to excellence in system administration and security, showcasing my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical, real-world scenarios. The comprehensive documentation serves as a valuable resource for fellow developers and enthusiasts, contributing to the broader community's understanding of robust server setups and security protocols.<br>
